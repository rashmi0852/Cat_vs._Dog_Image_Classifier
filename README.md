## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rashmi0852/cat-vs-dog-image-classifier.git

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data

- The dataset used for this project consists of images of cats and dogs.
- The data is divided into a training set and a test set & preciction in dataset folder as https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tSolq1anEpBzlCwtpn8aQKMM_cpO-o6X?usp=sharing
- Data augmentation techniques have been applied to the training set to improve model performance.

## Model

- The image classifier is built using a CNN architecture.
- The model  is defined in 'CNN_Model.ipynb' and can be customized as needed.
- For model details, refer to the project code or documentation.

## Training

- The model is trained using the training dataset with data augmentation.
- Training parameters and hyperparameters can be adjusted in the code.
- Model training progress and metrics can be monitored during training.

## Prediction

- You can use the trained model to predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog.
- Sample  for prediction should be placed in the 'CNN_Model.ipynb' file in 'Prediction' section.

## Results

- The project provides classification results for images based on the trained model.
- Results and model performance can be evaluated by referring to the project code or documentation.

## Conclusion

- This project serves as a foundation for image classification tasks and demonstrates the use of CNNs for binary classification.
- Further improvements and fine-tuning can be explored to enhance model accuracy and performance.
